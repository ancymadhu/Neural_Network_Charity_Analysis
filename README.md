# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Analysis Overview

With the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we used the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

The following technical analysis are done:

> 1. Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
> 2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
> 3. Optimize the Model

## Resources

* Data Source: Alphabet Soup Charity dataset (charity_data.csv)
* Software: Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Conda 4.8.4, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results

### I. Data Preprocessing

> * Variables that are considered the target for the model

   The variable that was considered is the IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

> * Variables that are considered the features for the model

   The columns other than the dropped ones became the features for the model.
 
> * Variables that are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data

   Removed the "EIN" and "NAME" columns as they did not offer any relevant data that could help the model perform better.

### II. Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

> * Number of neurons, layers, and activation functions selected for neural network model





> * Reagrding the target to be achieved
> * Steps taken to try and increase model performance
